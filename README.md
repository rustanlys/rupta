# RUPTA: A Pointer Analysis Framework for Rust

> :warning: [Documentation for RUPTA] is under development.

This open-source framework, RUPTA, supports pointer/alias analysis for Rust, operating on Rust MIR. It currently offers callsite-based pointer analysis,
as detailed in our CC'24 paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3640537.3641574).
## Requirements

* Rust nightly and components, as specified in [rust-toolchain](rust-toolchain.toml).

## Build

1. Clone the repository

2. Build & install

    You can build RUPTA in two different ways:

    ```sh
    $ cargo build
    ```

    This command generates two binaries, `cargo-pta` and `pta`, in the `target/debug` directory.

    You can also install RUPTA into `cargo`:

    ```sh
    $ cargo --locked install --path .
    ```

    This enables you to perform pointer analysis on a Rust project using the command `cargo pta`, similar to other `cargo` commands such as `cargo fmt`.


## Usage

You can run RUPTA for **a Rust project** using the binary `cargo-pta`:

```sh
$ cargo-pta pta -- --entry-func <entry-function-name> --pta-type <pta-type> --context-depth <N> --dump-call-graph <call-graph-path> --dump-overall-metadata <overall-metadata-path> --dump-pts <pts-path>
```

You can also use the command `cargo pta` instead of `cargo-pta pta` if RUPTA has been installed into `cargo`.

Alternatively, you can run RUPTA for **a single file** using the binary `pta`:

```sh
$ pta <path-to-file> --entry-func <entry-function-name> --pta-type <pta-type> --context-depth <N> --dump-call-graph <call-graph-path> --dump-overall-metadata <overall-metadata-path> --dump-pts <pts-path>
```

Options:

* `<entry-function-name>`: Specifies the entry function. Default is `main()`.
* `<pta-type>`: Determines the type of pointer analysis. Options are `cs` (callsite-sensitive) or `ander` (andersen), with `cs` as the default.
* `context-depth`: Sets the depth of contexts in callsite-sensitive analysis. Default is 1.
* `dump-call-graph`: Outputs the call graph in DOT format.
* `dump-overall-metadata`: Outputs the overall metadata, including information about crates, functions and callsites.
* `dump-pts`: Outputs the points-to analysis results.
* `dump-mir`: Outputs the MIR for all reachable functions.

Note: RUPTA requires substantial computational and memory resources to analyze large Rust projects. If you encounter excessively long analysis times—often due to many functions reachable from main() during the analysis—consider upgrading to a more powerful computing platform equipped with additional memory (e.g., 128GB) and faster CPUs.

## LOG

Set the `PTA_LOG` environment variable to enable logging:

```sh
$ export PTA_LOG=info
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors loading shared libraries, such as `librustc_driver.so`, try setting:

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
